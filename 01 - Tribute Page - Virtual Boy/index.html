        <p>The Virtual Boy is a 32-bit table-top video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. Released in
            1995, it was marketed as the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic "3D" graphics. The player uses
            the console like a head-mounted display, placing their head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome
            display. The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and
            by early 1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development, releasing only 22 games for the system.
        </p>

        <p>Development of the Virtual Boy lasted four years and began originally under the project name of VR32.
            Nintendo entered a licensing agreement to use a "3D" LED eyepiece technology originally developed by
            U.S.-based company Reflection Technology. It also built a factory in China to be used only for Virtual Boy
            manufacturing. Over the course of development, the console technology was down-scaled due to high costs and
            potential health concerns. Furthermore, an increasing amount of company resources were being reallocated to
            Nintendo 64 development. Lead Nintendo game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, had little involvement with the
            Virtual Boy software. The console was pushed to market in an unfinished state in 1995 to focus on Nintendo
            64 development.</p>

        <p>The Virtual Boy was panned by critics and was a commercial failure. Its failure has been cited as due to its
            high price, monochrome display, unimpressive "3D" effect, lack of true portability, health concerns, and low
            quality games. Its negative reception was unaffected by continued price drops. "3D" technology in video game
            consoles reemerged in later years to more success, including in Nintendo's 3DS handheld console. The Virtual
            Boy is Nintendo's second lowest-selling platform after the 64DD.</p>
