                <p>In this document we are going to show you how to play rock, paper, scissors. The game is really
                    simple to play and can be played without any additional tools needed. Many games are derived based
                    on this simple concept.</p>
                <p>The game requires two players. More are allowed, but it usually makes the game more complicated than
                    it should.</p>
                <code>Requirement: 2+ players</code>

                <header class="section-title">How to Choose</header>
                <p>To begin playing, you and other players shake your hands twice. Some will say rock, paper, scissors,
                    and then shoot, shaking their hands 3 times each for rock, paper, and scissors and then showing
                    their choice with shoot.</p>
                <p>When players reveal their choice they must show it correctly and clearly. For example, scissors may
                    sometimes look like paper if more fingers come out.</p>
                <code>Setup: Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot!</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="winning">
                <header class="section-title">Winning</header>
                <p>You win by picking the choice that is strong to your opponent. Rock is strong against scissors.
                    Scissors is strong against paper. Paper is strong against rock.</p>
                <p>If both of you made the same choice, go again until there is a winner.</p>
                <code>Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="more_than_two_players">
                <header class="section-title">More Than Two Players</header>
                <p>There are many variations of the game with more than 2 players, but the most popular seems to be that
                    the game doesn't end until one person can beat everyone else.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, if there are only 2 of the 3 choices made by all players, any players who made the weaker
                    choice would be eliminated and the game would continue with the players remaining. This is called a
                    battle royal style and helps shorten the game.</p>
                <code>NOTE: Wouldn't recommend more than maybe 4 players as games can get REALLY long otherwise...</code>
